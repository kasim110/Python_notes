# Introduction

Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 
has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.

Even though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be out-of-date.
So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version.

# Keywords
Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

In Python, keywords are case sensitive.

# Identifiers
An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
1.Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
2.An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
3.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
